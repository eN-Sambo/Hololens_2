# Hololens_2
This "Hololens_2" repository is just the start. I want to share what I find with researchers and everyone else. At the same time, I'm also working with ROS2 to connect my research with robots and computer vision. Plans might change, but that's okay - it's all about learning while doing. I won't use the Hololens_2 hardware, only the emulator.

I wish myself good luck (Nasir/11:10am/02/06/2024)
