# Hololens_2
This repository (Hololens_2) is one of many to come.
My aim is to share my finding with research communities and to the general public.
While working on this, I am also concurrently working with ROS2 to enable me integrate my my research to robotic manipulation and computer vision.
The plan/aim working along might change, but that is the whole purpose, to learn while working.
I will not be using the hololens_2 hardware but rather the emulator.

I wish myself good luck (Nasir/11:10am/02/06/2024)
